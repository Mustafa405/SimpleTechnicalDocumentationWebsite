        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other languages.</p>
            <p>Python has a large and active community which contributes to its extensive libraries and frameworks, making it suitable for various domains including web development, data science, machine learning, and more.</p>

        <section id="syntax">
            <h2>Syntax</h2>
            <p>Python syntax is clear and concise, making it easy to learn and understand. Indentation is significant in Python, as it uses whitespace to define block structures. This removes the need for explicit block delimiters such as braces used in languages like C or Java. Python uses dynamic typing and supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.</p>
            <p>Python's syntax encourages the use of English-like keywords which enhances readability. For example, "if", "else", "for", "while", etc.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="variables">
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>In Python, variables are used to store data values. They do not need to be explicitly declared and their data type is dynamically determined. Variables can hold different types of data such as numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc. Python variables can be reassigned with values of different types during execution. Variable names are case-sensitive and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot start with a number.</p>
            <p>Python variables are references to objects in memory rather than containers that store values directly. This allows variables to point to different objects at different times.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="data-types">
            <h2>Data Types</h2>
            <p>Python supports various data types including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integers:</strong> Whole numbers without any decimal point.</li>
                <li><strong>Floats:</strong> Numbers with a decimal point.</li>
                <li><strong>Strings:</strong> Ordered sequences of characters enclosed within single or double quotes.</li>
                <li><strong>Lists:</strong> Ordered collections of items, mutable and can contain elements of different types.</li>
                <li><strong>Tuples:</strong> Similar to lists but immutable.</li>
                <li><strong>Dictionaries:</strong> Unordered collections of key-value pairs.</li>
                <li><strong>Sets:</strong> Unordered collections of unique items.</li>
                <!-- Add more data types as needed -->
            </ul>
            <p>Each data type has its own set of methods and operations for manipulation and access.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="operators">
            <h2>Operators</h2>
            <p>Python provides various operators to manipulate data values. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arithmetic operators:</strong> Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), exponentiation (**), and floor division (//).</li>
                <li><strong>Comparison operators:</strong> Equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).</li>
                <li><strong>Logical operators:</strong> AND (and), OR (or), and NOT (not).</li>
                <li><strong>Assignment operators:</strong> Assign values to variables (=), increment (+=), decrement (-=), multiply (*=), divide (/=), etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Bitwise operators:</strong> Perform bit-level operations on integers such as AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Operators in Python follow precedence rules, and parentheses can be used to control the order of operations.</p>
